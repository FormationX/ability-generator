Friend of the Forest
 
Innate: The Hero cannot attack nor damage non-epic monsters. Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2.5 second channel that will plant a grove upon the camp. Placing a grove costs 131 − 70.14 (based on level) health and 135 − 66.15 (based on level) mana. The channel cannot be cancelled in the first 0.15 seconds and in the last 0.5 seconds.
The Hero cannot place a grove while he is unable to cast abilities.
The grove matures over 40 − 1 (based on level) seconds. When fully matured, The Hero can target the camp again to free it after a 0.5-second cast time, clearing the camp and receiving the full gold and full experience bounties. Using Smite on a monster within the grove will instantly free the camp regardless of maturity.
If the camp's large monster has already been slain prior to planting a grove, The Hero will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain.
Starting at level 5, freeing the Red Brambleback or the Blue Sentinel leaves behind a sapling for 60 seconds that can be gathered by one allied champion to gain the camp's respective buff, either the Crest of Cinders or the Crest of Insight, for a reduced 90 seconds.

Mortal Steel
RANGE: 450 / 450 /  1050
COLLISION RADIUS: 100
WIDTH: 80 / 160
SPEED: 1500
CAST TIME: 0.4 − 0.133 (based on bonus attack speed)
STATIC COOLDOWN: 4 − 1.33 (based on bonus attack speed)
 
Active: The Hero thrusts his Steel Sword in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies hit and applying on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectiveness to the first enemy hit. Mortal Steel's damage can critically strike for (47% + 29.4%) AD bonus physical damage.
Physical Damage: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+ 105% AD)
If Mortal Steel hits an enemy with the thrust, The Hero gains a Gathering Storm stack for 6 seconds, which refreshes upon receiving the second stack.
 
While The Hero has two stacks of Gathering Storm, the effect of Mortal Steel changes: the stacks are consumed to cause The Hero to dash a fixed distance in the target direction and unleash a whirlwind that advances in the same direction. The dash and the whirlwind both deal the same amount of damage to all enemies hit in their path and knock them up for 0.75 seconds, but they cannot affect the same target twice.
Mortal Steel's thrust is interrupted if The Hero is affected by disarming crowd control during the cast time but its cooldown is reset to 0.1 seconds.


Spirit Cleave

Total Mixed Damage: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+ 11 / 12 / 13 / 14 / 15% of target's maximum health)
The Hero shields himself for 35 − 55 (based on level) (+ 55% bonus AD) for 1.5 seconds if Spirit Cleave hits an enemy, increased by 100% if it hits a champion and by 50% for each subsequent champion hit.


Soul Unbound

CAST TIME: None
COOLDOWN: 22 / 19 / 16 / 13 / 10

Spirit Form: The Hero becomes ghosted, gains 10% − 30% (based on time active) bonus movement speed and marks champions damaged with basic attacks or abilities. Each mark stores a percentage of the post-mitigation damage that The Hero deals to each of them with his basic attacks and abilities.
Damage Stored: 25 / 27.5 / 30 / 32.5 / 35% of damage dealt
Activation resets Way of the Hunter's current sword state. Soul Unbound can be recast after 0.5 seconds, and automatically does so after the duration.
 
Recast: The Hero remains in cast time for 0.25 seconds then dashes back to his body, ending Spirit Form and detonating the marks on each champion to deal true damage equal to the amount stored against each of them. The Hero is displacement immune from the point of reactivation until the dash is completed and, at the end of the cast time, he will cleanse himself from all immobilizing effects and polymorphs* that were applied to him during the cast time as well as all blinds, cripples and drowsy effects.
The automatic recast is delayed if The Hero is winding up a basic attack or is unable to recast Soul Unbound under any circumstances, which includes if he cannot move or cast abilities. Soul Unbound will also immediately recast upon death or entering resurrection.


Fate Sealed
RANGE: 1000
WIDTH: 225
CAST TIME: 0.75
COOLDOWN: 120 / 90 / 60
 
Active: The Hero prepares a strike over the cast time, then marks all enemies within a line in the target direction, knocking them down and stunning them for 1 second, as well as blinking 200 units beyond the center of the last enemy champion struck. If no enemy champions are struck, The Hero blinks to maximum range instead.
After 0.3 seconds, wind then rushes along the same line, dealing equal parts physical and magic damage to marked enemies that are within the area and pulling them towards the location The Hero blinked to and subsequently knocking them up for 0.75 seconds when the displacement ends.
Total Mixed Damage: 200 / 400 / 600 (+ 80% AD)
The stun ends prematurely upon the knock up.

Cell Division
STATIC COOLDOWN: 300
Innate - The Secret Weapon: The Hero gains increased percentage size equal to 1.5% of his bonus health, capped at 35% increased size at 2333.33 bonus health. The Hero's size also reduces based on his missing health, down to 70% total size while at 0% health.

•	  Stretching Strikes: 1 chunk for each strike hit (excluding the collision) on different targets, up to 2
•	  Unstable Matter: 1 chunk if it hits at least one target
•	  Elastic Slingshot: 1 chunk for each enemy champion hit
•	  Let's Bounce!: 1 chunk for each bounce that hits an enemy champion, up to 4

Any damage the bloblets receive, excluding damage dealt in excess of their total health, is also redirected to The Hero in true damage. While in resurrection, The Hero is untargetable and unable to act, and cannot take damage from sources other than the redirected damage from his bloblets.
If any of the bloblets remain alive by the end of the duration, The Hero is revived with 10 - 50% maximum health. If all bloblets are killed, the resurrection ends and The Hero dies.

Active: The Hero stretches his left arm in the target direction that catches the first enemy it hits, dealing them magic damage, slowing them by 40% for 0.5 seconds, and forming a tether between The Hero and the target for 2 seconds, during which the target is revealed.
Magic Damage: 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 (+ 30% AP) (+ 2.5% of The Hero's maximum health)
While the tether persists, The Hero's next basic attack is replaced by a second Stretching Strike, empowering it to have a 0.25-second cast time, gain 25 bonus attack range, deal the same magic damage and apply the same slow. This attack cannot critically strike.
If the two Stretching Strikes affect different targets, both targets are rooted for 0.5 seconds and receive the same slow and, after a 0.4-second delay, The Hero displaces them towards each other for 300 range, though not through terrain.
If the two targets are near each other, they're slammed against each other instead of toward each other via the displacement, both additionally taking the initial magic damage again and becoming knocked up and stunned for 0.25 seconds upon impact with each other. Enemies near the impact are also dealt the initial magic damage.

If The Hero cancels the channel himself, or the charge completes without reactivation, 50% of Elastic Slingshot's health cost and cooldown are refunded.

Recast: While in range of each other, The Hero and his  Shadow blink to their respective locations, swapping places. If Living Shadow was recast while the  Shadow is dashing, the recast will instead occur once it has been placed.
If an ability is cast while the  Shadow is dashing, the  Shadow will cast that ability once it has been placed. Living Shadow will cast at max range if cast beyond that.

For the next 3 seconds, The Hero stores a percentage of all pre-mitigation physical damage and magic damage he and his  Shadows deal to the marked target, detonating at the end of the duration to deal physical damage.
Physical Damage: 65% AD (+ 25 / 40 / 55% of damage dealt)
 
Recast: Regardless of the distance between each other, The Hero and the Death Mark  Shadow blink to their respective locations, swapping places.
